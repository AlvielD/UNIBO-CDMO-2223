# CDMO-Project
The project consists on solving the Multiple Couriers Planning (MCP) with at least three of the approaches seen in class. In particular, for this project we chose the following approaches:
1. **Constraint Programming** (CP)
2. *# TODO: Choose between SAT and SMT*
3. **Mixed-Integer Linear Programming** (MIP)

## Configuration
Each approach has its own configuration. For the CP approach we used [MiniZinc](https://www.minizinc.org/) *specify later the solver and its configuration*

## Documents
*# TODO: Remember to fill the links on this section*

The specific description of the project can be seen in [this](https://github.com/tramba99/CDMO-Project/docs/CDMO_Project_2023.pdf) pdf file. The template used for the report was given by the teacher and contains useful information on how to implement the project, it can be checked [here](https://github.com/tramba99/CDMO-Project/CDMO_Project_Template.pdf) file.
